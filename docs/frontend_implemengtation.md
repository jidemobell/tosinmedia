Security Considerations
Authentication:

Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for user and admin authentication.
Ensure secure password hashing (e.g., bcrypt).
Data Validation:

Validate all inputs on both the client and server sides.
Role-Based Access:

Restrict admin routes and APIs to admin users only.
Stripe Integration:

Use Stripe's secure APIs for payment processing.
Conclusion
This system is designed to minimize user stress while giving the admin full control over user accounts, bookings, and testimonials. It avoids unnecessary data collection and provides a streamlined experience for both users and the admin.
