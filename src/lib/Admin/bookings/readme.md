To implement a Booking Management system based on your requirements, we can create a BookingManagement.svelte component that lists all bookings and provides links to user details, event details, booking history, and payment receipts. Here's how we can structure and implement it:

Proposed Structure for BookingManagement.svelte
Booking List:

Displays all bookings from the latest to the earliest.
Includes columns for booking_user, event name, event date, booking_created, completed, amount, payment medium, and updated.
Links:

User: Links to the user's details page.
Event: Links to the event details page.
History: Links to the booking history page.
Payment Medium: Links to the receipt or payment status.
Booking History Table:

A separate table or modal to display the history of changes to a booking.
